    "# Motivation\n",
    "When putting together a blog post, there are several steps that are time consuming. For instance, creating a directory with the date for the slug, then a title name and followed a YAML header that suits the format of the article. All this can be time consuming and hence in this post I will show how I have automated the creation of template posts to write code right away rather that setting this up\n",
    "\n",
    "- Goal: from a simple command line i.e. `mkblog notebook 'How to rock'` a folder with the current date and the title-name i.e. `2023-08-21_how-to-rock` will be created. Then the script should copy a pre-build post model that will modify the header's date, title, href (for downloable Jupyter Notebooks) i.e:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",

    "# Creating the script\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that came to my mind when creating the script was to the type of post. On a general level I have classify them in three categories\n",
    "\n",
    "- post: this is a normal `qmd` file that can hold articles and is capable to run R, Python, JavaScript and so on.\n",
    "- poems: this is a `qmd` modified version that enables the formatting that you see in my [poems](../#category=Poems).\n",
    "- notebook: this is a `ipynb` file that can be executed using my conda environments\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is now how to set all this up. Reviewing at scripting languages and ways on how to create [extension](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/) for html files I realised all this could be done with [python](../#category=Python).\n",
