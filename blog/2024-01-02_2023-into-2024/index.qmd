Hi all, it is already 2024 ðŸ¥³

There has been many changes since I started this blog. In this section I want to give a short summary of what has happen in 2023.

## Highlights of 2023 {.unnumbered}

- I have joined University of Amsterdam as a master student in Artificial Intelligence
- I concluded my internship in Belgium as a Computer Vision Engineer. 
- I have attended a couple of seminars related to AI

## What I am looking forward?{.unnumbered}

I have selected the following elective courses for my electives:

- Deep Learning 2
