![TCS Marathon 2022 | Amsterdam, The Netherlands ](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/polar-marathon-amsterdam-1665995197.jpeg)

The idea of running a marathon its exiting. Specially when I did a half-marathon and reach the goal feeling a champ.  

:::{.callout-note title="Disclamer"}
I am in no way or shape perform at a competition level, but my interest and the environment that surounds running has pulled me the triger to get information from many sources. Thus, in this post I want to share my experience how I am training.
:::

# Background

I have some experience running. In 2015, I joined the athletics team at my high-school. At the age of 17 years old there was I running long distances. Little do I know however on how to compete for more than 15km. Even though I have finished a half-marathon that was a long time ago (man how times flies).

Thus, the thing that I consider important and among the ones I remember can be cited as follows:

- 6 week day training
- proper shoes
- what you eat what you are
- time tracking its important

The question that comes to my mind is then: what is the difference between training for 10km or 42km. I will come back to this point and dont want to make it rocket science but for the rest of this post I will be sharing my learnings

# The sources 
One of the important resources that I consider is Youtube. Predictable, well yeah. I think tree quartes of my training have been done by watching at other people advise. It's also not surpisisng why I also would like to spend some time looking for the proper training schedule to prepare for the marathon.

Statistics say that around 14 weeks are the bare minimum to prepare for a competition. At the time of writing this it would be around that limit so I feel confident that I would do well.

## During the training
To prepare runnign at be acustomed during the competition after looking at some post and blogs I have decided to come up with my own plan, the idea is to prepare it by my own because I will be still be bussy during the month of October

For that reason, I have compelled the following traning plan, after looking analysis how other do it.

### The pace

From experience I know it can be tricky to fall into the tramp or going as fast as other people will do it. I have made this mistake and I find myself not sticking to my goals. The whole purpose of training its to test how capable I am and compare myself with myself. Thus, to avoid 'hittin the wall' I would like to analalize...
