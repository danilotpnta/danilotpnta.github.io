## Bayes Theorem
$$
\begin{align}
p(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C)P(C)}{P(X)} \\
\end{align}
$$

Where: 

- $P(C|X)$ is the **Posterior** (Given the data what is the prob of being class C_k)
- $P(X|C)$ is the **Likelihood** (How the data is distributed given C)
- $P(C)$ is the **Prior**
- $P(X)$ is the **Evidence**/ Marginal likelihood

The evidence $P(X)$ can also be decomposed in:

$$
\begin{align}
P(X) &= \sum_{j}{}P(X,C_j)\\ 
     &= \sum_{j}{}P(X|C_j)P(C_j) \\
\end{align}
$$
