It’s the name of your computer. You had to enter that during the system installation.\n[PATH] is your current working directory, the directory you’re currently operating on. When you open a new terminal, the default directory is your current user’s home directory. A synonym for /home/YOURUSERNAME is ~.\n[SYMBOL] is usually either $ if you’re operating as any normal user, or # if you’re operating as “root” user.\n\nSo your Bash prompt looks like this:\nganesh@ganesh:~$\nThat means you’re logged in as user ganesh on a computer called ganesh as well, currently operating in your own home directory (~). Of course you’re not “root”, therefore the $."

All of these places, stored in the variable called “PATH”, are searched whenever we are typing a command in the terminal window.\nIf the command we are trying to use is present in any of the directories listed in our PATH, we don’t need to point at its specific location in full (its path, lowercase) when we are trying to use it – which is of course nice for things we use often."

Bear with Danilo.\n\n\n\n\nThe reason\nI have come across the question on where to host the models that I have trained and display its outputs in an interactive way.\nWhile doing some googling I came across different technologies which much of which have been recently launched, provided the pletora of machine learning application these days. So here a couple of things that I have learnt:\n\n\nStatic websites just got better!\nFor static websites, there is pretty much not too many available options. Statics sites like this one make use of javascript as the backbone to run expensive tasks and usually data science tools these days operate with Python, Julia or R.\nBeing said that, pyscript seems to pose a first steps on how to run python in HTML. Found this was a relief because then I discovered that Python code is able to be written in a portable binary-code format WASM, which in turn means you can write Python and run it at the server side. For a more thorugh explanation about this you can check this video explanation.\n\n\nIf Python available which technology to use?\nHere gets tricky, if you want to have a fast and easy to deployment usually there is no much customization, and by that I mean curky ads and logos like: made by.. not to much fan of those. Following a simple chart that I have found really usefull to solve my enquires, I am attaching the source link here for reference.\n Source: 1\n\n\nThe decision\nAll set and stone, I have only some requirements to jump into learning a new technology and those are\n\nScalable: I want to be able to not just use it for my blog but for future work as well\nOn the look: if it has not been used for the last couple of years then something new is on the look\nBalance-learning-curve: I have learnt Haskell and let me tell you, prototyping and designing code is another world in functional language. So I want be a eager learning while still discovering more tools next couple of months in the road.\n\nConsidering these facts: I am planing to stick with Shiny for the time being."

    "text": "1 Motivation\nWhen putting together a blog post, there are several steps that are time consuming. For instance, creating a directory with the date for the slug, then a title name and followed a YAML header that suits the format of the article. All this can be time consuming and hence in this post I will show how I have automated the creation of template posts to write code right away rather that setting this up\n\nGoal: from a simple command line i.e. mkblog notebook 'How to rock' a folder with the current date and the title-name i.e. 2023-08-21_how-to-rock will be created. Then the script should copy a pre-build post model that will modify the header’s date, title, href (for downloable Jupyter Notebooks) i.e:\n\ntitle: \"How to create Dynamic plots\"\ndate: \"2023-08-21\""

    "section": "2 Creating the script",
    "text": "2 Creating the script\nThe first thing that came to my mind when creating the script was to the type of post. On a general level I have classify them in three categories\n\npost: this is a normal qmd file that can hold articles and is capable to run R, Python, JavaScript and so on.\npoems: this is a qmd modified version that enables the formatting that you see in my poems.\nnotebook: this is a ipynb file that can be executed using my conda environments\n\nThe question is now how to set all this up. Reviewing at scripting languages and ways on how to create extension for html files I realised all this could be done with python.\nHere down below the script that makes all this possible\n\n2.1 Make a Directory\n\n\ncreate_dir.py\n\n\nimport os \nimport sys\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport shutil\n\ndef create_post(type_file, post_name):\n\n    # Save a copy only name\n    raw_post_name = post_name\n\n    # Example: \"how-to-rock\"\n    post_name = post_name.lower().replace(\" \", \"-\")\n\n    # Current Date: \"2023-08-21\"\n    current_date = datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n\n    # Folder name: \"2023-08-21_how-to-rock\"\n    folder_name = current_date + '_' + post_name\n\n    # Current Directory path\n    current_dir = os.getcwd()\n    \n    # Output Directory\n    output_path = current_dir + \"/out\"\n\n    # Folder Path: \"../out/2023-08-21_how-to-rock\"\n    path_folder = os.path.join(output_path, folder_name)\n\n    # Make a Directory\n    os.mkdir(path_folder)\n    print(\"Directory '% s' created!\" % folder_name)\n\n# Name of Post\n# 0 is the name of the py file\n# 1 is the first argument\n\ntype_file = \"notebook\" # sys.argv[1]\npost_name = \"how to rock\" # sys.argv[2]             \n\ncreate_post(type_file, post_name)\n\nDirectory '2023-08-21_how-to-rock' created!\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Copy, move & edit a Blog’s Template\nAfter we have created a folder, we can proceed to make a copy of a user-defined template with settings that we may want to use for that specific type of post. For instance for my notebook posts I want to modify the date of the header, its title name and the ref link to download the output of the Jupyter notebook.\nFor this to scale and be able to fire the script from any directory I will point to a specific folder where I will make all this changes and then move those modified files to my ../blog section.\nThe structure of my files where the script is stored is as follows:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n_extensions\n└── mkpost\n    ├── create_dir.py\n    ├── out\n    ├── splitWin.app\n    └── templates\n        ├── notebook\n        │   └── index.ipynb\n        ├── poems\n        │   └── index.qmd\n        └── post\n            └── index.qmd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo print the tree structure you see above I have used: brew install tree and then tree &lt;path&gt;\n\n\nIn the folder view you find mkpost as the folder that holds the script previously shown. There is also out folder which contains the folder just created 2023-08-21_how-to-rock. There is also splitWin.app which will talk in section  and lastly a folder called templates where you can see index.* files that will be copied to our newly created folder.\nFollowing the continuation of the python script that does all the moving, copying and editing.\n\n\ncreate_dir.py\n\n\ndef create_file(type_file):\n    # -------------- CREATE FILE --------------\n    # Holds available extensions\n    dic = {'post': 'qmd', 'poems':'qmd', 'notebook':'ipynb'}\n    file_extension = dic[type_file]\n    \n    # Source path: \"../template/file_type/index.ext\"\n    source_file = f\"templates/{type_file}/index.{file_extension}\"\n    \n    # File name \"index.ext\"\n    file_name = f\"index.{file_extension}\"\n\n    # Destination path: \"../out/2023-08-21_how-to-rock/index.ext\"\n    destination_file = os.path.join(path_folder, file_name)\n\n    # Creating a Copy from Template folder\n    shutil.copy(source_file, destination_file)\n\n    # -------------- UPDATE HEADER --------------\n    lines = open(destination_file, 'r').readlines()\n    \n    if (type_file == \"notebook\"):\n        title_row = 9\n        lines[title_row] = f'    \\\"title: \\\\\"{raw_post_name.capitalize()}\\\\\"\\\\n\\\",'\n\n        date_row = 11\n        lines[date_row] = f'    \\\"date: \\\\\"{current_date}\\\\\"\\\\n\\\",'\n\n        code_name_row = 16\n        post_code_name = post_name + '.out.ipynb'\n        lines[code_name_row] = f'    \\\"      file-name: {post_code_name}\\\\n\\\",'\n\n    else:\n        title_row = 1\n        lines[title_row] = f'title: \"{raw_post_name.capitalize()}\"\\n'\n\n        date_row = 3\n        lines[date_row] = f'date: \"{current_date}\"\\n'\n\n    file = open(destination_file, 'w')\n    file.writelines(lines)\n    file.close()\n    \n    # -------------- MOVE FILE --------------\n    # Folder Path: \"../out/2023-08-21_how-to-rock\"\n    src = path_folder\n\n    # Path to Blog\n    dst = \"../../blog\"\n    shutil.move(src, dst)       \n    \n\nif (type_file == \"post\"):\n    create_file(\"post\")\nelif (type_file == \"notebook\"):\n    create_file(\"notebook\")\nelif (type_file == \"poems\"):\n    create_file(\"poems\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Wrong type_file: {type_file}. Available: 'post', 'poems' or 'notebook'\")\n    sys.exit()\n    \n\nThe code above does the following:\n\nWhen the user inputs the name and the type_file it looks at the template folder with the specified extension and does the copying\nUpdates the header changing date to the current date at the moment of creating the directory, title with the name we input in the terminal and, lastly if is a notebook it changes the href to enable the user download the notebook.\nOnce all changes are done, the folder with the index.* file are move to the blog section."

These shells, as it comes to not surprise, can launch scripts with user-defined strings defined.\nFor my liking I have decided to proceed with:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nmkblog [type_file] [\"name_post\"]\n\nTo enable this, you have to cd to your .bash_profile or .zshrc in my case. Then we will define the alias mkblog and will do the following:\n\ncd to the path where we have stored our python script. That is _extensions\nExecute the script using python\nOpen my workspace in Visual Studio\nOpen the index.* we just created i.e. in the dir \"2023-08-21_how-to-rock\"\nMake quarto render that file.
